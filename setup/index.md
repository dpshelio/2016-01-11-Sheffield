## Testing your setup

This directory contains scripts for testing your machine to make sure
you have the software you'll need for your workshop installed.  To use
these scripts:

1.  Download [swc-installation-test-1.py](swc-installation-test-1.py).

2.  Run it from the shell:

    ~~~
    $ python swc-installation-test-1.py
    Passed

3.  Download [swc-installation-test-2.py](swc-installation-test-2.py).

4.  Run it from the shell:

    ~~~
    $ python swc-installation-test-2.py
    check virtual-shell...  pass
    ...
    Successes:

    virtual-shell Bourne Again Shell (bash) 4.2.37
    ...

    If you see something like:

    ~~~
    $ python swc-installation-test-2.py
    check virtual-shell...  fail
    ...
    check for command line shell (virtual-shell) failed:
